# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis: Flight Delays Report.

### Project Overview

This report investigates the relationship between flight delays and customer satisfaction for an airline company, using data analysis to derive insights and recommendations. The focus is on departure time as a critical metric for customer satisfaction.

### Executive Summary

Flight delays are a significant challenge for the airline industry, directly impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing departure delays, leveraging a dataset with 25,574 observations across 9 variables. Key findings reveal that nearly half of all flights (47%) are delayed, with specific patterns emerging based on flight type, purpose, and category.

### Objective

Analyze flight departure data to:
- Identify patterns and factors contributing to delays
- Provide actionable recommendations to minimize flight delays

### Key Findings

- Current Performance:
Only 53% of flights meet the industry benchmark for on-time departures (â‰¤15 minutes from the scheduled time).

- Connecting vs. Direct Flights:
Delayed departures are more prevalent in connecting flights (62.5%) than in direct flights (45%), highlighting operational inefficiencies in handling transit passengers and cargo.

- Business vs. Leisure Flights:
Business flights exhibit a higher proportion of delays (60%) compared to leisure flights (44%), possibly due to scheduling flexibilities catered to business travelers.

- Flight Categories:
"City Hopper" flights have the highest number of delays (~4,800), followed by intercontinental (~4,200) and holiday flights (~1,000), emphasizing route-specific challenges.
